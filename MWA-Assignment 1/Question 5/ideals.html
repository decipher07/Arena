            <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
            <p>Ronaldo says “talent” plays an important role in life but “ethics of work” while being the professional football player is what matters most to him. Ethics of work — I think it is much meaningful term. We all of us must have our work ethics designed by ourselves to head towards success.</p>
            <p>In Terms of Discipline and Hard Work, I really see Ronaldo as my Ideal, Who has achieved so much by his consistent efforts and hard work</p>
